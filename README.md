# test
This is a test repo to get everybody up to speed with git and github.

### OK, I'm here. What do you want me to do?
I want you to read this document. So far so good!

### What is this Github stuff?
That's kind of like asking "What is coding?". Seriously, this readme will only teach you what you need to know for our purposes. In fact, even that is a stretch. This readme will teach you enough that you can do things wrong and learn from your mistakes.

It's OK to make mistakes.

One thing that's good to know is that [_git_ is not the same thing as _github_](http://jahya.net/blog/?2013-05-git-vs-github). Git is a version control system that you install on your local machine. Github is a nice way to use git for collaborative coding.

### Got it! How do i get started?
There are a few things you need to do first:

 - Create a github account
 - Set up git on your development machine
 - Add your local git identity to your github account

#### Creating a github account
This is _not_ the same as your KTH github account, if you have one. Otherwise it's pretty straightforward.

#### Set up git on your development machine
Pick a computer that you really like and follow github's [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

#### Add your local git identity to your github account
The prefered way of doing this is via ssh keys. Again, github has a nice [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/).

### Wow, that was easy and nothing went wrong and rainbows and stuff. What next?
Now we're going to do some actual versioning.
